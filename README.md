**Physical Address**: Laboratory I-52, Information Science Building I, 1-1 Asahidai, Nomi, Ishikawa, Japan  

I graduated from Beijing Institute of Technology, a top-ranking university in China, with a Master's degree in Software Engineering in 2023 and a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry in 2021. I am pursuing a Ph.D. at JAIST, with an expected early graduation in March 2026. My research focuses on exploring the internal mechanisms of artificial neural networks, particularly Transformer-based neural language models, during both training and inference by mathematical and representation learning methods, and improving their performance robustly through this deeper understanding. I have published over 20 papers / presentations in this area since 2023, some of which have been presented at top-tier international conferences such as ICLR and NeurIPS.

I am actively seeking productive research collaborations in the mentioned area. If you are interested in working together, please do not hesitate to contact me. I welcome collaborations with both experts and motivated beginners—being a novice is not a drawback if you are eager and efficient to learn. Additionally, I am open to exploring collaborations in other areas as well.
